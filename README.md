## Why contribute to Open-Source

I hate google for 1 reason which is no privacy. Long back when I was  
searching a way to escape from google's privacy exploitation I came  
across FOSS and F-Droid which basically is an app store full of  
open source apps. After knowing the presence of such a huge userbase  
for open source apps, I wanted to contribute to them so people/users  
like me can find a way to escape from user data collecting companies  
like google.
